currently a sample of 2500~
then runs through all possible relationships and takes the 10 w/ closest euclidian distance and forms a 'similar' edge
nodes themselves are the songs as they appear in the csv generally
chosen fields for euclidan distance calc are: 'popularity', 'explicit', 'danceability', 'energy', 'loudness', 'speechiness', 'acousticness', 'instrumentalness', 'liveness', 'valence'
these have all been normalized w/ min/max normalization and are treated as equally important
feel free to change whatever you'd like but I figure this is a pretty good start
also make sure to change the user/pass to whatever you chose for your local instance
